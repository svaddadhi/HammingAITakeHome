# Voice Agent Discovery System Design Document

## System Overview

The Voice Agent Discovery System is designed to automatically explore and map out the conversation paths possible with AI voice agents. It systematically places calls, processes responses, and builds a comprehensive map of the agent's capabilities through synthetic conversations. Think of it as an automated explorer that charts unknown conversational territory, similar to how a web crawler discovers and maps websites.

## Core Architecture

### Component Structure

The system is organized into several key modules that work together:

1. Discovery Orchestrator

   - Acts as the central brain of the system
   - Manages the overall discovery process
   - Maintains the state of exploration
   - Coordinates between other components
   - Implements backoff and retry strategies

2. Call Manager

   - Handles all interactions with the phone API endpoints
   - Manages rate limiting and concurrent calls
   - Implements retry logic for failed calls
   - Tracks call status and recordings

3. Conversation Analyzer

   - Processes audio recordings into text
   - Analyzes responses to identify new paths
   - Determines appropriate follow-up prompts
   - Identifies when a conversation branch is complete

4. State Manager

   - Tracks discovered conversation paths
   - Maintains the conversation tree structure
   - Identifies unexplored branches
   - Prevents redundant exploration

5. Progress Reporter
   - Provides real-time console updates
   - Generates visual representation of the discovery process
   - Logs important events and milestones
   - Creates final report of discovered paths

### Data Structures

The conversation tree structure is fundamental to this system. Each node represents a conversation state and contains:

```typescript
interface ConversationNode {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  response: string;
  children: ConversationNode[];
  status: "unexplored" | "in-progress" | "completed";
  metadata: {
    timestamp: Date;
    callId: string;
    depth: number;
    path: string[];
  };
}
```

## Process Flow

1. Initial Setup Phase

   - System configuration validation
   - API connectivity testing
   - Setting up webhook server
   - Initializing state management

2. Discovery Phase

   - Start with root-level prompts
   - Queue exploration tasks
   - Process responses
   - Identify new branches
   - Update conversation tree

3. Analysis Phase

   - Process audio recordings
   - Extract meaningful information
   - Identify conversation patterns
   - Detect terminal states

4. Documentation Phase
   - Generate visual representation
   - Create detailed path documentation
   - Export discovered scenarios

## Key Algorithms

### Path Discovery Algorithm

The system uses a modified breadth-first search approach to explore conversation paths:

1. Start with initial greeting
2. For each response:
   - Analyze content
   - Generate relevant follow-up prompts
   - Queue new exploration tasks
3. Track exploration depth
4. Implement cycle detection
5. Handle terminal states

### Response Analysis

Implements natural language processing to:

1. Categorize responses
2. Identify key information requests
3. Detect conversation state changes
4. Recognize completion signals

## Error Handling and Resilience

The system implements multiple layers of error handling:

1. Call-Level Resilience

   - Retry logic for failed calls
   - Exponential backoff strategy
   - Circuit breaker pattern for API calls

2. State-Level Resilience
   - Periodic state snapshots
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - Progress preservation

## Performance Considerations

1. Concurrency Management

   - Parallel call processing
   - Rate limiting compliance
   - Resource utilization control

2. Memory Management
   - Efficient tree structure
   - Periodic cleanup
   - Resource poolingI'll create a comprehensive design document for your voice agent discovery system. Let me break this down into clear, logical sections that will guide the implementation.
